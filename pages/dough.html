    <h2 id="main">Overview:</h2>

    <p>
        During Winter 2019, I joined Infolab: an extracurricular through the School of Information that provides 
        students with semester-long opportunities to act as design consultants for real-world clients. My client that 
        term was Dough — an MBA-founded startup focusing on an effective digital way to tackle the student loan problem 
        rampant in America.  
    </p>

    <p>
        By conducting UX research and developing both a low and medium-fidelity for their product, I was able to gain 
        valuable, working knowledge of the UI/UX sphere. While I can’t disclose too much of what I did for Dough, feel free 
        to reach out to me if you have any questions!
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges:</h2>

    <p>
        Initially, this was a difficult project for me. Not only was this project my first foray into UI/UX design and
        consultancy, I also had no understanding of the student loan space I was consulting for. Fortunately for me, my
        client was completely understanding of that fact and provided ample readings to understand both the pain points
        and the potential benefits of their solutions. By doing all these readings and asking my clients many questions, I
        was able to gain an understanding of the student loan space and provide my clients the feedback they were looking for.
