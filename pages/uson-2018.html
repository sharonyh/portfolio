    <h1>USON Card King 2018</h1>

    <p>
        While vacationing in Taiwan during the summer of 2018, I was fortunate enough to find and intern at USON Card King, 
        a small graphic design firm located in Taichung. While they mostly specialize in designing business cards for 
        clients, I also had the opportunity to design fliers, stamps, stickers, and web banners for clientele.
    </p>

    <h2>Process:</h2>

    <p>
        The turnaround time for each project I received was about a day. For everything I designed, I was required to 
        make at least two versions for the client to choose from — one version might include serif font, and the other 
        sans-serif to give clients a sense of how certain typography might affect their branding. Once I had completed 
        two initial drafts, I would send them over to my manager, who would review them and give me feedback to iterate on. 
        After finishing my second draft, I would send the designs to clients for approval.

        expandImg.src = imgs.src;
        // imgText.innerHTML = imgs.alt;
        expandImg.parentElement.style.display = "block";
    }
    </script>

    <h2>Challenges:</h2>

    <p>
        Fun fact: I once asked my mom what my proficiency in Mandarin was and she labeled it as, “About the same level as 
        a Taiwanese kindergartener.” Understandably, as a graphic design firm in Taiwan, the main languages spoken there 
        were Mandarin Chinese and the Taiwanese dialect. So with Mandarin being my second language, I struggled for a 
        while to quickly adjust to both the language barrier and the overall cultural difference. But because of these 
        hardships, I completed my internship with not just a better understanding of design thinking and graphic design, 
        but also an improved conversational fluency in Mandarin Chinese.
